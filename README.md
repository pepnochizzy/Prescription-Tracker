Instructions on how to run your app:
As a user, when you first load the website/app, you will be taken to the homepage. This will display the most important information, and offer navigation to other pages with different purposes. The information on the homepage shows which of the current day's prescriptions are still left to take, as well as the current day's prescriptions the user has already taken. Underneath this there are some buttons that allow the user to access multiple of their trackers, although different trackers for different functions are a future feature, as for now the app is based around one type of tracker. The top nav bar (bottom of screen on mobile) is all about navigating around the app, in order to add a prescription to your tracker, the user must click the "new tracker" button. This will take the user to a form in which they fill out all the necessary information for the reminder feature to work. To see a more in depth look at all the prescriptions in the tracker, the user can click the "see tracker" button, this will then display a more detailed look at the prescription tracker. It still contains the "left to take" and "already taken" sections from the homepage, but also contains a "prescription overview" section, which lists all added prescriptions, regardless of whether they are prescriptions that are/were needed on the current day. The user can click on the name of the prescription in order to see all relevant information about that medication.
