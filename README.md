Project description:
An app to track prescriptions and set reminders for when to take/when to reorder

Problem domain:
\*\*People can't always remember what food items they have in their houses, and coming up with recipe ideas isn't always easy.

# Sinead
User stories:
\*\*As a user, I want to see a list of the items I have in my pantry.

A list of any libraries, frameworks, or packages that your application requires in order to properly function:

# Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.
- The application must include both client-side and server-side code. ✔️
- Ensure the application is fully responsive and works across modern browsers. ✔️
- Use Express.js to set up your server and define API endpoints. ✔️
- Use Supabase with the PG library for database operations. ✔️
- Implement async/await and the Fetch API for non-blocking database operations and API calls. ✔️
- Demonstrate an understanding of database design, relationships, and SQL queries. ✔️
- Design and Planning: Create wireframes and plan the layout and functionality of your web application.
      We were able to create wireframes and plan our layout, this was followed throughout the project.     
- Front-End Development: Develop the user interface with HTML and CSS, focusing on a responsive and intuitive design.
      Our project uses html and css to offer a paired back, clinical design. We opted for simplicity to make our product accessible for a wide range of users. We believe it is easy to navigate and understand.
- Interactivity: Implement dynamic content on the front end using vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation.
      We have used DOM manipulation for showing prescriptions on the page alongside the times to take or when they were taken. Once the medicine has been taken, they move into the correct divs. We also chose to show a snapshot of the tracker on the homepage for simplicity and ease of access.
- Back-End Development: Build a server with Express that handles HTTP requests and communicates with a Postgres database.
      We have a server that connects to a Supabase database, this is where all prescription info is stored. In an upscaled version of this app we would have to have tables for each user and secure them to protect data. Currently our app is designed as though you are one user that has logged in.
- Database Integration: Design a database and use Postgres to store, update, and retrieve data efficiently using SQL queries.
      A link to the screenshot is in Figma, this shows the database/table used. Our form section is able to send data to the database whilst the homepage and tracker page are able to collect the data and display it dynamically.
- Collaboration: Work as a team to design and build a web application that showcases your skills in full-stack development, and collaborate on code using Git and GitHub.
      For the most part, we were able to maintain communication and follow our original plans. Our GitHub collaboration became very strong, we knew how to merge and pull appropriately alongside reviewing eachother's code.
      As a team we were able to provide solutions when group members asked for help.
