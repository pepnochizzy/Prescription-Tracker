### Project description:
An app to track prescriptions and set reminders for when to take/when to reorder

### Problem domain:
People often have different prescription information kept in various locations/on paper. 
They have to remember when to take their prescriptions and when to re-order, which can be difficult when someone is unwell or there are multiple to manage.

### User stories:

🐿️ As a user, I’d like to fill out a working form so that I can submit my prescription information effectively and without issues.

🐿️ As a user, I want the application to work as expected on my mobile device so that I can access and use it conveniently on the go.

🐿️ As a user, I want to easily view all the medications I need to take each day, based on what I have inputted into the form.

🐿️ As a user, I want to be reminded to take each medication at the correct time and date.

🐿️ As a developer, I want to create a working API GET route so that I can retrieve data from the server and display it to the users.

🐿️ As a developer, I want to create a working API POST route so that users can send data to the server and store it.

🐿️ As a developer, I want to create and seed a database with dummy data so that I have realistic test data for development purposes.
